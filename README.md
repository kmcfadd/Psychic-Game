Welcome to the Psychic Game. Here you are to guess what letter the computer has chosen.

Any keypress will begin the game and you have 9 guesses to win.

All game data is available, including your wins, losses, guesses remaining, and what letters you have already guessed.

When correctly guessed, the game will alert you the correct guess and reset.

If the 9 guesses are exhausted, you will lose and the game resets with a new letter chosen.

Good luck and have fun.
